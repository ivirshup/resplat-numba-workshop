This way it can just dispach to compiled code which performs a defined set of operations on those objects. Numba is able to look at python code and figure out what the fast cpu code would be. In practice, this means loops and flow control are no longer slow."

    "So what was this magic decorator that made the code so fast? It's a function which looks over the python byte code and translates it to LLVM IR. It [has a few options](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/user/jit.html) which modify how this is done:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `nopython=True`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use the bare `@jit` decorator, numba will try to speed up the function, but won't throw an error if it fails. Passing `nopython=True` ensures that your function will be compilled, and is probably what you want. This is recommended so strongly that the also provide `njit` â€“ which is equivalent to `@jit` with `nopython=True`. In the future, `nopython=True` will become the default for `@jit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `cache`\n",
    "\n",
    "As you saw above, numba only compiles a function once it is called. Unfortunatley, this means that everytime you restart python numba will need to compile a function again when it's called. Passing `cache=True` makes numba cache the compilled function to disk, so it doesn't need to compile again. This is useful for complicated functions, which can have compile times longer than their run time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `parallel`\n",
    "\n",
    "A pretty cool option. If you pass this `numba` will try and make your code run across multiple threads. This is covered more by one of the challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explicit types (eager compilation)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know the types you want to compile a method for, you can specify them by passing `numba` a type signature string. This is out of scope for todays workshop, but you can find out more [here](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/user/jit.html#eager-compilation)"
