# resplat-numba-workshop

## Getting setup

Before coming to the workshop, please have an python 3.6+ environment with numba and jupyter installed ready to go. I recommend doing this through `conda`:

```sh
conda create -n numba-workshop python=3.7 numba numpy ipython notebook pandas seaborn networkx scikit-learn
```

If you don't already have conda installed, you can find detailed instructions in the [official docs](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) or in this [replat guide](https://github.com/resbaz/Sept2017_PandasWorkshop/blob/master/Python_installation.md).
